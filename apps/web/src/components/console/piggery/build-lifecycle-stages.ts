 * Turns a batch's real stage history into the lifecycle stepper's model.

 * The stepper previously rendered DEFAULT_PIGGERY_STAGES — a hardcoded eight
 * stages with fixed 2025 dates and three of them permanently marked "Done" —
 * for every batch, regardless of where the batch actually was. That contradicted
 * the rest of the page: the stage filter beside it lists only the stages the
 * batch genuinely entered, so the two disagreed on screen.
 *
 * Completion is derived from batch_stage_log, not from sequence position: a
 * batch that started mid-lifecycle never "completed" the stages before it.
