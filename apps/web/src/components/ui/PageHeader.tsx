/**
 * The page header — level 3 of the three navigation levels in apple.design.md
 * §10, and the single implementation of the content hierarchy in §9:
 *
 *   breadcrumb → title → description → actions → toolbar → work surface
 *
 * The breadcrumb is not a prop. It belongs to the same reading order but it is
 * derived from where the user is, not from what the page renders, so the shell
 * emits it once directly above this element (see `AppShell`). Keeping it there
 * means every route has exactly one breadcrumb landmark whether or not it has
 * been migrated, and no page can accidentally render a second one.
 *
 * This header lives inside `<main>`, not in the global chrome. It carries
 * `data-shell-region="page-header"`, so on desktop it pins to the top of the
 * main scroller under the Phase 1 geometry — the scroller is `<main>` itself
 * and nothing between them establishes a new overflow context, so
 * `position: sticky` resolves against the real scroller. Below the desktop
 * breakpoint the document scrolls and the global header and module index are
 * already pinned; a third pinned band there would eat the work surface, so the
 * header scrolls with the page instead.
 *
 * The API is deliberately small. Everything variable is a slot, so pages
 * compose rather than reach for another styling flag:
 *
 *   <PageHeader
 *     title="Suppliers"
 *     description="Vendors and raw material suppliers."
 *     actions={<Button>Add supplier</Button>}
 *   />
