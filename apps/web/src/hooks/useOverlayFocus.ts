 * Focus management for a modal overlay: entry, trap, and restoration.

 * Dialog and FullPageOverlay each carried their own byte-identical copy of this
 * logic, with FullPageOverlay's comments pointing at Dialog's as the original.
 * Drawer would have been the third. One implementation now serves all three —
 * the trap is subtle enough (see below) that three copies drifting apart is a
 * real risk, not a stylistic complaint.
 *
 * Escape is deliberately *not* handled here. Dialog and Drawer close on it,
 * FullPageOverlay closes on it, but Popover also stops its own Escape from
 * reaching an enclosing overlay — the routing of that key is a per-overlay
 * decision, so each caller keeps it.

 * strand Tab on the entry before it rather than the browser skipping past it.

 * focus inside the panel in between, and that assumption does not hold: focus
 * sits on the panel (not in its content) right after opening, and WebKit omits
 * buttons from sequential navigation entirely, so an overlay whose controls are
 * all buttons leaks focus on the first Tab.
 *
 * Restoration is synchronous cleanup, never a timer. If the trigger is gone
 * from the document by then — a row action whose row was just deleted — focus
 * is left alone rather than thrown to the top of the page.
